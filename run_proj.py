#STEP 1 below
#pasted from website
import ResearchOS as ros #originally was researchos

ros.DBInitializer() 

#STEP 1 DONE
#all worked

#STEP 2
# should specify HOW we are creating dummy_data.csv
# I'm left wondering if it matters how I make it, do I just make my own excel doc?
# might seem obvious but I would say something like "you can make this csv file using excel or what ever you normally use"
# how do I get it into the project? do I just drag it into the project folder? 
# if uploading the dummy data is an another step I would also say something like "this step is just to create the data, we will connect it to our test projet in the next step"

# i liked the text the end explaining what the fake data means, again seems obvious but it makes it easier to follow along

#i made my dummy_data by saving excel as a CSV (comma deliminated)

#STEP 3
#should specify to create dataset.py inside of new research_objects folder

#typo: Data Objects are custom defined IN each project

#should also specify that data_objects is different than dataset and 
#it is just a little strange bc we made a new file (dataset.py) but then we need another new file (data_objects.py) to paste the new code into
#I'm assuming I paste the new code into data_objects but thats also not specified

#code & comments in research_objects/data_objects

#how you did "Type the following into research_objects/datasets.py:" is really helpful
